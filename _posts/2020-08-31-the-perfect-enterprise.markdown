I think we all feel unity and value personal/physical interaction more than in the past 10 years. From countless heart-warming initiatives to the fact that we suddenly have great sympathy for our prime minister. All of us against that nasty virus. On the other hand, a divided world feels like something from years ago, when ‘World War 3’ was Twitter’s trending topic only 3.5 months ago. 

We found ways to stay connected with each other through video calls. You could say that our personal and work lives have finally gone through their own digital transformation. One day, if that is in 2 months or 5, this situation will be over. What will we then do with these new ways of interaction and collaboration that we discovered?

*Will we go back to our offices? Or will we continue working from home regularly? Will we keep embracing technology such as [Google Meet](https://devoteamcloud.com/staying-connected-with-chat-and-meet/), [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/start), and [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/business/)? Or resent it because it reminds us of crisis-times?*

## Critical comments on this mass technology adoption
So, me being me, of course I look at this from a technology perspective. So far it has not really changed technology. It is, however, changing the way we use it. Video calling is great. It keeps me connected. And we start using it massively. I was quite used to a regular video call but not to the amount that I have now. I also see people that barely did this before completely changing to this new way of working in a matter of days. And it’s not only video calling but there are all kinds of tools to help us share information. This piece, for example, was written by [Guido Dijkhuizen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guido-dijkhuizen-marketing) and myself, working in the same document at the same time while hanging out in a video chat. Amazing right?

That’s all great. It is easy and accessible. You stay connected and business can continue.

These new developments, however, also raise questions on **privacy**. Who has access to your data? Are the connections that you use secure? Or are we shortcutting these questions for the sake of continuity?

But then again, **continuity** also needs to be considered in itself. For example, the cloud seems to be something with a limit. [Azure is filling up](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/03/24/azure_seems_to_be_full/) and apparently some people are unable to start new VM’s on Azure. We’ve also learned that the cloud can break. Just last week [Google had an issue](https://twitter.com/uhoelzle/status/1243217659690278912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1243217659690278912&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F9to5google.com%2F2020%2F03%2F26%2Fgoogle-down-march-2020%2F) affecting a lot of people working from home. 

This quick digital transformation of our way of working also exposes that we are highly dependent on tech-giants to virtually work and interact. These giants are helping us a lot at the moment. They open up their network, often for free, to get you up and running in these challenging times. Kudos to them!

This said, in the long run, you have to consider the amount of **dependency** that is acceptable for your business. You have to start asking yourself questions about the impact on business continuity.

## How to move forward?
The interesting thing is that we see the mass adoption of technology allowing us to work remotely. We all experience pretty great user-friendliness as well. We also love the large tech companies for helping us out.

But...

*If this way of working becomes the new standard, we also need to think about privacy, accessibility, and continuity. What do you think? How should technology evolve to optimally support business processes?*
