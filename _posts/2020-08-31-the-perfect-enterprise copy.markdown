You want to grow your business and stay ahead of the competition. You probably understand that, in a disrupted economy, you have to change your ways to achieve that. So you read a lot about things like agile, Scrum, DevOps, SRE, etc. You visit conferences and talk to the gurus but that does not give you the answer to everything. It all sounds logical and makes a lot of sense but what should your organization look like? How does this all apply to your specific challenges?

Let me try to describe “The Perfect Enterprise”. Because I do believe that there is an answer to your questions, although it might be a little bit different than you expect.

## Set goals and keep track of them
Let’s start with what you want to accomplish. This might seem like common sense, and that might be just it, but all too often I see that people start following the latest trend just because others are doing it as well. The point in question is the [large following of the Spotify model](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/please-stop-implementing-spotify-model-gert-jan-van-halem). Although that might work for Spotify, it will not guarantee success for you. You are most probably in a different industry facing different challenges.

If you are in IT the [four key metrics](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/four-key-metrics) could be a good starting point. But still, keep in mind that you are contributing to the success of the whole enterprise. From years of research done by [DevOps Research and Assessment](https://cloud.google.com/devops), we know that having a successful software development and operations department benefits the success of the whole company. So you have to align with the vision of your company.

Thanks to the same research we have gotten a better understanding of the driving factors of a successful software development and operations department. The earlier mentioned four key metrics are driven by a whole set of capabilities. By looking at your data and analyses you can learn which one you should invest in to improve your performance to help your company to achieve the vision.

Do not just copy someone else’s success. Focus on the vision of your organization. Find out what is going on in your department. How well do you score on all the capabilities of your organization? Then start learning how you can make the next step towards your goals. Improve your capabilities, measure the effect, take action and repeat.

## Open is better than closed
Share, share, share. You know your goals and you know how to get better results through data-driven decision making. Don’t just stop there but also share what you learned. Not only internally, but also externally. Some find that wrong. It might give your competitors an advantage, right? For a couple of reasons that is not true.

Almost all companies are part of a larger supply chain. There are hardly any companies that can design, build and deliver products or services completely by themselves. Those few who do are likely to be disrupted sooner than later. That means most companies also have to work together in a larger ecosystem of multiple companies. The definition of an enterprise is more than the description of one company but spans multiple organizations.

Sharing helps to improve processes at your suppliers as well as your customers, resulting in a better value for the users. This ensures your success in the supply chain as a learning and sharing organization.

Open is not only meant for the process side but also for the side of your service. This enables your vendors and customers to work together with you through open standards, opening up information that is essential to them through APIs. That is a form of openness that has enabled things such as the platform economy.

## It is a process, not a state
I kind of hope that this is obvious by now. The perfect enterprise is not a fixed state that can be described and that you can strive towards. It is about implementing processes that enable you to keep on learning and adapting. Your vision should be the main guidance for the direction that you want to take.

That process can be quite common to a lot of companies. It dates back to the development of the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) which is also described as a process. The results will differ. So do not try to achieve a fixed state that you call perfect because it will be outdated fast. But adapt the rigorous process of continuous improvement. Rediscover yourself and have the courage to act accordingly. Keep your vision clear for everyone and let that be your guidance.

## It is an evolution, not a revolution
The journey you are now on is an evolution. There is not one big all changing revolutionary step or action that will make you a perfect company. It is a process of trying to improve and learning from your mistakes every day. Dare to change what needs to be changed. Take it step by step. 

Sometimes that requires a big leap forward. There will be smaller steps and larger steps to take. Keep your vision clear and be willing to change your organization to deliver on that vision. 

## Conclusion
I strongly believe that nothing is that good that it can not be improved. So perfect is a relative term. Trying to become perfect is not, and that is actually the whole point. You have to accept that you are never there and always try to improve in such a way that your goals are getting closer. Having good data to make informed decisions, having the courage to act on those decisions, and sharing your learnings internally and externally is what makes your enterprise perfect.
